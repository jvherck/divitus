## Privacy Policy
### Stored Data
- User IDs
- User names
- Server (aka guild) IDs
- Message IDs

### Data Usage
- User IDs are stored in the database to store every player's statistics and items for the bot (users who did not use an "economy" command will not be saved into our database).
- User names are saved to make it easier to organise stuff and quickly find the right information.
- Server IDs are used to store the server settings and make sure your server keeps its own customisation.
- Message IDs can be stored for the bot's configuration or special commands.

### Access To Data
Only the bot developer has access to the database and is the only one allowed to view this information.

### Contact
If you want to contact me regarding the bot, you can join the support server or DM me on `jvh#8686`. It's possible I might change tag or name, my correct username is always show on the `/info` command!

### Data Removal
If you want your _personal data_ to be removed from the bot you can use the **command** `/settings reset True`: this will delete all your information in the bot. (Note: this will remove all your progress too since your information is wiped from the whole database!) \
\
If you want your _server (=guild) data_ to be removed, you can join the **support server** and open a ticket to let us know. We will remove this data. (Note: normal commands with prefix will not work anymore, and some other features of the bot might not work either!)


## Troubleshooting
### Bot not reacting to message commands although it's online
It's possible something went wrong while the bot automatically sets itself up when joining your server. If it doesn't respond to anything, join the support server, open a ticket and give the server/guild ID of the server with the occuring problem.
